A test of the NEAT library for the use in stock trading.

Creates a population of trading bots, and runs across three days of the BTC-USD chart at 1 minute intervals. Each bot can buy or sell at each interval. After each run the best members of the population are used to create a new one, through crossover and mutations.

Some runs created bots that yielded a 0.7% return after three days.
